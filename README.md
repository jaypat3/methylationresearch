Hello,

These are some code snippets of research I'm currently doing into DNA methylation, namely with studying its impact on gene expression. The GeneTableModifiedProbes.R file is where the base tables come from, showing the impact of methylation
and other epigenetic factors on gene expression in order to determine when methylation alone is responsible for gene expression change. From there, one can study the enrichment of these methylated genes in biological process sets,
such as cell adhesion and leukocyte migration, and determine whether there is a survival/clinical outcome associated with these processes as a result of methylation. These impacts are investigated in the two survival csv files.
An example of a base genetable is found in the genetablebrca file.
